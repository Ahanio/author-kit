# About

The last version of CVPR/ICCV LaTeX template had been developed by Paolo.Ienne@di.epfl.ch and awf@acm.org about 15 years ago.
That version suffered from several issues:
1. Authors needed several individual files: cvpr.sty, cvpr_eso.sty, eso-pic.sty.
2. For CVPR/ICCV rebuttals, another version of cvpr.sty was required.
3. Several warnings arose due to deprecated options.

More recently, Ming-Ming Cheng (cmm_spam@nankai.edu.cn) created a single style file that helps to unify review, rebuttal, and final versions with a class.

This more recent style has been further modernized for CVPR 2022 by Stefan Roth (stefan.roth@NOSPAMtu-darmstadt.de).
